found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow

away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred

yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where

the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,

where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not

mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge

of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the

highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,

so there was an end to that clue.



“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill

and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see

that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an

instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then

beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man

had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed

had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled

with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength

causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had

returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his

opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and

who was it brought him the coronet?



“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,

whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew

that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained

your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son

allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible

reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent

explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret
