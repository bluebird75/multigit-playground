have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes

the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had

best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our

_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”



And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper

beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a

broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.

They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of

Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr.

Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in

Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a

government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet

Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no

further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of

one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at

Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
