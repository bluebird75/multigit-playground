“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were

all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your

I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese

off you?”



“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.



“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”



“She told me to ask you.”



“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough

of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer

flitted away into the darkness.



“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come

through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring

stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him

“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked in a quavering voice.



“You will excuse me,” said Holmes blandly, “but I could not help

overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I

think that I could be of assistance to you.”
