matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!

data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And

yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I

was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those

all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I

would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and

find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the

morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the

message, threw it across to me.



“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his

chemical studies.



The summons was a brief and urgent one.



“Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,”

it said. “Do come! I am at my wit’s end.





“HUNTER.”





“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.



“I should wish to.”



“Just look it up, then.”
