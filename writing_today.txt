the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came

out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his

path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in

the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe,

been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of

absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.



“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,

and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather

together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no

friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these

vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land

which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the

hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for

over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and

a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the

villagers almost as much as their master.

time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even

as mine has.”



“Your sister is dead, then?”
