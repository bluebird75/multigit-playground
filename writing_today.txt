night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he

had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the

strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her

room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,

chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to

leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.



“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the

dead of the night?’



“‘Never,’ said I.



“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your

sleep?’



“‘Certainly not. But why?’



“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the

morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has

awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next

room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you

whether you had heard it.’



“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’



“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did

not hear it also.’



“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’
